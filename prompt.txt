This paper employs a qualitative research approach, synthesizing secondary data from peer-reviewed
articles, industry reports, and white papers published between 2017 and 2025. Sources were selected
based on relevance to GenAI’s technological foundations, applications, and ethical debates.
A thematic analysis was conducted to identify recurring themes in the literature, focusing on three key
areas: 1. Technological Foundations – including neural architectures, training methods, and scaling
laws. 2. Applications – spanning text generation, image synthesis, and cross-modal creativity. 3.
Challenges – ethical, societal, and regulatory concerns.
4. Applications of Generative AI
